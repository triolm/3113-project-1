# Train
This is an animation of a train!! I kind of hyperfixated on this project so there's uh. maybe a bit more going on than the project requirements asked for.

## Usage
`make run`

## Known Issues
I really don't like how the sun is animated. No matter what I do it looks kind of weird, and I think it's taking away from the vibe.
